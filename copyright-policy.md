**DRAFT**

The goal of ELL-i is to create and provide an open source hardware and
software platform for Power-over-Ethernet powered fixed appliances, in
the Internet of Things (IoT) fashion.  To archieve this goal, the
ELL-i co-operative is currently forming its copyright policy.  On this
page, we explain the envisioned copyright policy and related
background thinking.

## Goals

We would like the ELL-i platform to be

* beneficial to the whole human community, through making it easier to
  build PoE-powered fixed devices, and more generally, smart,
  low-power micro grids supporting such devices,

* to foster research, education, and the maker community to innovate
  and invent new concepts and things without needing to care about
  legal aspects during the innovation phase,

* to allow commercial deployment by companies that build upon the
  ELL-i platform and at the same time contribute back to ELL-i in a
  form or another.

To achieve these high-level goals, we believe that it is essential to

* make it enjoyable and easy enough to contribute to the ELL-i
  platform while simultaneously making sure that the platforms remains
  a high-quality one,

* invite contributing community members to apply for a membership
  of the ELL-i co-operative,

* to provide a set of benefits to co-operative members, including
  things like being able to aqcuire development tools at a discounted
  price, and other ones that we cannot put in writing right now :-),

* to establish a commercial licensing mode that is both fair towards
  to all of the contributors, including both those that are ELL-i
  co-operative members and those who have not wanted to apply for
  membership. 

## Tentative copyright policy

To achieve the goals above, the co-operative 
* asks the contributors to assign the code copyrights to the
  co-operative,
* licences the thus forming body of copyrighted source code and design
  under an open source licence to the general public, for
  non-commercial use, and
* licenses the body of source code under a commercially viable licence
  to commercial parties that want to build products on the top of the
  ELL-i platform.
